## 👋Hello! 
# I'm Chandratej Kurella
### Cloud Data Engineer | Data Analyst | GCP & AWS Specialist
A cloud native data expert with 5 years of experience transforming fragmented datasets into real-time, business-critical intelligence. I don’t just build pipelines -- I engineer ecosystems that move data with precision, power, and purpose.

Armed with a Master’s in Business Analytics from California State University, East Bay, I’ve architected scalable solutions across cloud first and data intensive environments. My toolbox spans GCP, AWS, Apache Spark, Kafka, Informatica, and more., but tools are just the medium. The mission? Making data work harder, faster, and smarter.

From crafting CDC frameworks that sync global systems in real-time, to building metadata-driven ETL pipelines that think for themselves, I design with scalability, resilience, and clarity in mind. Whether it's infrastructure telemetry or digital product analytics, I deliver clean, reliable pipelines that teams can trust and business can build on.

If you're building for scale and ready to make data a competitive edge — I'm all in.
